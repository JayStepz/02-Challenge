# The J. Stephens' Student Portfolio
## Who am I? What is this for?
Hello, my name is Jakob Stephens, and welcome to Jack-I mean, welcome to my lowly (for now) portfolio! This page has an old picture of myself from a wedding two years ago, an About Me section filled with Lorem text (to be changed at some point), two images with hyperlinks to the respective projects of mine, and a third image that is acting as a placeholder for a future third project! Of course, my totally super-legit absolutely not fake contact information is listed at the bottom of the page! I forgot to mention that the boxes at the top right of the screen will take you to each respective named section of the page, too!

Just wanna give a shoutout to the staff, and to all of the many webpages I've found through Google while trying to get this to (mostly) work!
